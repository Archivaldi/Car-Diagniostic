                            and is a unique number.<br>
                            <b> Simplify - VIN - is the code of vehicle as DNA code for human.</b>
                            This number is assigned by the vehicle manufacturer and identifies the make, model, model
                            year, as well as more detailed
                            information such as engine type. <br>It is used for all type of vehicles (passenger
                            vehicles,
                            commercial, trailers, buses,
                            motors, mopeds). Vehicle marking system VIN is in line with international standard ISO
                            3779-1983 and in practice has
                            been operating since 80's of 20th century. Standard has been accepted by most of countries

                            thirty years. The manufacturer
                            is responsible for the uniqueness of the VIN label.
                            <br>
                            With a unique VIN number of each vehicle, you can track vehicle history - damage & theft
                            records.

                            Vehicle history reports are important elements to make a correct decision while buying used
                            car.<br>

                            <b>The VIN number is composed of three parts:</b><br>

                            <i>The first part of three characters (WMI)</i> clearly identifies vehicle manufacturer
                            (person,
                            company or corporation),<br>
                            <i>Second part identifies vehicle (VDS)</i> consists of six characters and should determine
                            general
                            vehicle features (encoding
                            and sequence of characters depends on manufacturer),<br>
                            <i>Third part distinctive vehicle (VIS)</i> consists of eight characters with obligatory
                            last four
                            digits. If the manufacturer
                            specifies in that part, year and plant, it is recommended to put year on the first place and
                            the plant code on the
                            second.<br>
                            It is allowed to use in the VIN number Arabic digits and large Latin letters, i.e.: 1, 2, 3,
                            4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0 and: A,
                            B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z with the exception of the
                            letters: I,O,Q.

                            In addition to above, on the vehicle or the vehicle plate can be used, various separators.
                            These are symbols, signs,
                            rims to separate VIN parts or indicate its beginning and the end. Selection of the separator
                            depends on manufacturer,
                            but can not be a character already used in VIN or other which can be similar. In the
                            documentation separators can not be
                            used and VIN number of the vehicle should be written in one line without any space between.
